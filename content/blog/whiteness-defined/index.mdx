So this is "whiteness"? I never knew I was that one dimensional. But you know what, I can live with that. Although you obviously don't have to tick every box, this reads like a recipe for success.

I'm just wonderingâ€¦ If this is whiteness, what is blackness? Is that by definition the opposite of all these things?

It's one thing to have a brainstorm session to gather a list of notable "differences". But I can't believe they actually attributed those differences to a skin color and then made the effort to put that list on a nice infographic and actually release it to the public. Without any numbers or background.

Whatever, please watch this video for more context:
