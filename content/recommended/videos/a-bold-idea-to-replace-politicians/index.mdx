Life is messy and thus politics inherently too. I am always confused about my feelings towards it. I know we cannot do without it and so far democracy seems to be the best way we have to channel it. However, I also believe that power corrupts and politicians cannot be blindly trusted. They say they do what is best for us, but how can we know that is true. There are just too much examples of the opposite.

But what then? We can't just dispense with politics and government altogether. Somehow we have to bring the decision-making back to the people. Not as in a 'peoples republic', but rather by some form of direct involvement, like referenda. That is however very impractical, time-consuming and expensive. César proposes a very interesting solution in this video though: get technology involved.
