When I first saw this video I was [still a lefty](/not-a-political-journey-too/#left-to-right). I believed, at least I said I did, that the government should help the poor and weak. Not everybody is capable of "making it". Society, no matter what political structure you choose, is inherently "unfair". So government should step in and help the ones on the bottom.

In this video Rutger proposes an idea to give everybody a basic income. According to him, research has shown that it works and makes people healthier and happier. When I first saw it, I thought it was an awesome idea and infuriating that nobody would acknowledge the research supporting it.

In the mean time I did a u-turn on this issue. I [don't believe it will work](/not-a-political-journey-too/#ubi). Yet without this video, I would've probably never given the idea any serious thought. That's the beauty of sharing ideas. You have to think about things, you would normally not even knew existed. You can then change your mind or improve your own arguments.
