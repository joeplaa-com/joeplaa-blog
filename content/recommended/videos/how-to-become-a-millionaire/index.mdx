I found this video after watching a video about [Rich Dad Poor Dad](/books/rich-dad-poor-dad) on the same YouTube channel. It explains that anyone can become a millionaire. It's not hard. Wow, really? I didn't know that. I grew up with the believe that "we" weren't the people to get rich ever. And now somebody said that was not true.

I bought the [book](/books/the-millionaire-fastlane) and read it twice. It made so much sense, everything clicked into place. It put me on a journey out of my fixed mindset (I will never be rich) and start my own business. I saw this video 4 years ago and I'm not a millionaire (yet), but I'm so much happier.
