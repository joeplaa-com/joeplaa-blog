I remember one thing from this video that made a big impact. Yanis explains that we don't only have a mountain of debts, but also a mounting of savings (idle cash). This mountain of idle cash is not used to invest in new ways to get people and coutries out of debt. Which is obviously a waste. Something I didn't know and hadn't realised before.

Yanis fears that this mountain of cash and the fear for our debts will be used to eat away our democracies. I agree that this is something to be very concerned about. I'm not sure how we can fix it though. I don't think we can force people to invest their money. We can only force our government to invest our money wisely.
