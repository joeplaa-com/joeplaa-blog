I found Tom through his show [Impact Theory](https://www.youtube.com/tombilyeu) on YouTube. There he interviews people to help viewer unlock their potential? "Our goal with this show and company is to share the ideas you need to begin executing on your potential."

Interviewing that many people, you have to absorb some ideas right? I wondered what Tom's own views were and luckily around that time they posted [a keynote](/videos/how-to-reach-the-top-with-no-previous-experience). It's amazing so when they released this keynote, I immediately watched it. Instead of focussing on the "you-can-do-it" mentality, Tom speaks more about taking responsibility, not only for your actions, but also for what happens to you.
