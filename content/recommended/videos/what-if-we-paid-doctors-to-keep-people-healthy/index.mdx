Doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies focus almost solely on treating sick people. Of course that is necessary and a good thing, but why is there almost no focus and attention on keeping people healthy. Are it the incentives (money) for treatments? Our insurance system that pays per action/treatment?

What if we would pay healthcare professionals for keeping people healthy? This probably leads to another host of issues like: how to measure someone's health? How to prevent companies and doctors from falsely claiming a sick person is indeed healhty? However, our current system doesn't work. Already sick people are send home and healhty people diagnosed with something. 

Food for thought.
