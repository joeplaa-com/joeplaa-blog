I can't remember why I liked this video. I think it has something to do with being good to the world, i.e. being progressive. I'm not sure if I still fully support this. The top ten countries he presents now seem to me to look too much to the outside, to their image. Countries that forget their own population and sacrifice freedom in favor of outward appearance. Something I need to think about some more.
