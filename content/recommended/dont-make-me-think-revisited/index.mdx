excerpt: "This book gave us the words to describe what we already knew and tried at jodiBooks. Software, website, interfaces should be intuitive and easy to use. Unfortunately that's often not the case at all. At jodiBooks we live by the lessons described in this book. It gives us the language to communicate what we know doesn't feel right (don't make me think!) and the tools to figure out how to measure it. Without this book, jodiBooks wouldn't be and stay as easy to use as it is now (obviously we can and want to keep improving the interface)."
