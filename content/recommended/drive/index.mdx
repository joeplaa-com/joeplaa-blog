excerpt: "Drive shows us what motivates us at work and at home. Although the message of the book is very interesting and I fully agree, what I like most about this book, doesn't even have anything to do with its message. This was the first book I read that sparked my interest in reading. I read a book once in a while, but they never made me read more. This book awoke something in me, as I never stopped reading ever since. I gathered a tremendous amount of knowledge and I definitely wouldn't be the man I am today, without this book."
