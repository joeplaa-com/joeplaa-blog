excerpt: "This book marked the second awakening, after the first with 'Drive'. It was on a vacation in Sicily, that I was bored and was mindlessly watching videos on Youtube. A summary of Rich Dad Poor Dad happened to be one of them. It immediately captured me: you don't need a finance degree to understand finance. It opened my eyes to explore things that I'm interested in, even if other people say it's too complicated. Without Rich Dad, I wouldn't have read 'The Millionaire Fastlane' and thus would still have a job and wouldn't have started jodiBooks."
