excerpt: "I used to think I wasn't made to be an entrepreneur or business owner. That I was somehow genetically incapable of doing that, or that I didn't have the education and connections to start a business. I didn't want to read this book at first, because of the title and my misconception about what I was capable of. This book has, however, changed my mind and life. MJ explains very clearly what you have to do to become a millionaire. It felt so intuitive and right. I even read it a second time a few months later, when his message settled in my mind and I could get practical."
