excerpt: "Finally, somebody who doesn't only tells me how I should think and what my mindset should be. Jordan also gives the practical day to day rules to follow to get to where you want to be. It's so easy to get lost and forget about how to act now to become who you want to be. These rules are a daily reminder and check if I'm still on the right path."
