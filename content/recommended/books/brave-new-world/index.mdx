excerpt: "Where 1984 pictures an ultimately depressing world, Brave New World seems to go the other way. Everybody is always happy and nobody has to worry. For me that is also a bleak, boring and bad perspective. The creepy thing to me is that we already are living in an age where most people just want to be happy and not worry. This book describes their ultimate dream."
