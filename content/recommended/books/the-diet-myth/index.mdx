excerpt: "The best 2 euro ever spend. Granted this book is worth way more than that, but still, thanks :) I bought it after I saw a talk by Tim in which he explains how we should treat our gut. We should see our gut as a garden in which we want to grow a diverse microbiome. We need to take care we feed it the right stuff and in turn it will take good care of us. It is a brilliant metaphor. In this book he goes deeper into the details of what it should be that we should and shouldn't eat. In the process he also explains what the information on food labels means and how we should read it."
