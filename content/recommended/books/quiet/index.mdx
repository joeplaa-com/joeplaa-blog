excerpt: "I always thought I was shy and awkward. I don't do small talk and I never know what to talk about. Unless I'm with the right people. Susan showed me that I'm not shy, I'm an introvert and I'm not alone. It's completely normal what I feel and how I move about in the world. Now that I know that, I have the confidence to stand behind my own wants and needs. I understand why some things make me tired and drain energy, while others just don't seem to get enough of it. Thank you very very very much Susan."
