excerpt: "Robin and John wrote a magnificent book. Being written by Cleese, you would expect something funny. And although sometimes it is humorous, it is far more serious. It categorizes people in three categories: healthy, normal, unhealthy. That being categories for peoples mental health and their mindset. It is such an enlightening way of looking at these two things. And the way these men use it to describe all facets of life is truly amazing. It changed my perspective on people and made me more empathetic towards people with different views, as it made me understand why they have such different ways of dealing with life."
